# yaml-re-org

This repository aims to be POC rewrite the source of yaml.org website in such way that it would be:

* easy to maintain (markdown)
* isolate content from style
* keep the final product a static website, so we can host it anywhere
* keep URLs working or put redirects in place
* add testing, so we can prevent broken urls or making changes that would render badly
